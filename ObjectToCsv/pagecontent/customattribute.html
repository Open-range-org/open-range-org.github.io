  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>In C#, when working with models, it’s common to encounter scenarios where the property names in the model differ
      from the column names in a CSV file. To address this issue, we can use the Header attribute. This attribute
      facilitates the mapping between CSV columns and model properties.</li>
    <li>Additionally, there’s another attribute called Ordinal. The purpose of this attribute is to help the library
      identify the order of CSV headers, which can be useful during data processing.</li>
